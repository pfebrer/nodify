# This config is used by pre-commit to run hooks on files before committing them to git
# To use it install pre-commit with:
#     `pip install pre-commit`
# and run
#     `pre-commit install`
# in the root of the repository
# From that point onwards, pre-commit will run the hooks on every commit.
# If pre-commit does some modification, the commit will fail. Add the
# changes done by pre-commit and commit again.
