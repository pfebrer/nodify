The nodify python package
--------------------------

If the Cambridge dictionary had an entry for the word "nodify", which it doesn't (for now),
it would look something like this:

-------------------------------------

| **nodify**
| verb
| *The art of converting python functions into nodes and connecting them to create a workflow. Once you start nodifying, you can't stop doing it.*
